1. `E5`The cage is very small
`D5/E`A tiny silver ball
That `A/E`makes you a hero
The `Am/E`moment you step inside
`E5`The world is watching you
`D5/E`What you're about to do
Will `A/E`live on forever
`Am/E`Even though you'll be dea`G#m7`d
And gon`C#7`e
Buckle `F#m7`up
We're about to turn the `A/B`engines `B7`on.

2. `E5`Hello from Sputnik 2
`D5/E`I am receiving you
`A/E`Thanks for the dog food
I'm `Am/E`somewhere above you now
`E5`Guess what Malashenkov?
`D5/E`I took the collar off
I'm `A/E`holding my own leash
And `Am/E`walking myself outsid`G#m7`e
This doo`C#7`r
I don't `F#m7`think
I want to be a `A/B`good dog `B7`anymor`E E/G# E/B`e

> Now I'm `A`floating `E/G#`free
And the `F#m7`moon's with `E`me
And it's `F#m7`bright enough
To `A`light the dark
And `E/G#`it's so `A`high up `E/G#`here
And the `F#m7`stars so `E`clear
Are they `F#m7`close enough?
Will they `F#m7b5/A` hear me
`Am/C`bark from here?

3. `E5`Moscow to Sputnik 2
`D5/E`I think we're losing you
Your `A/E`life signs are fading
We `Am/E`can't really say that we'r`G#m7`e
Surprise`C#7`d
It's a `F#m7`shame
There is always something `A/B`that gets `B7`compro`E`mise`E/G# E/B`d
