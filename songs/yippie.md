# Johnny B. Goode
## Chuck Berry

1. Deep `A`down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans,
`A`Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
There `D`stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where `A`lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who `E`never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could `A`play the guitar just like a ringin' a bell.

> Go! `A`Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go!
Go, Johnny, go! `D`Go!
Go, Johnny, go!
`A`Go! Go, Johnny, go! `E`Go! Johnny B. `A`Goode
 
2. He `A`used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
`A`Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.
Old `D`engineers would see him sittin' in the shade,
`A`Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made.
When `E`people passed him by they would stop and say,
'oh, my but `A`that little country boy could play'

3. His `A`mother told him, 'someday you will be a man,
`A`You will be the leader of a big ol' band.
Many `D`people comin' from miles around
Will `A`hear you play your music when the sun go down.
Maybe `E`someday your name'll be in lights,
Sayin' `A`'Johnny B. Goode tonight'
